# Cookbook
Cookbook is a digital cookbook implemented using Flask and SQL. The idea behind is that you have your favorite dishes, but they are spread out in several books or sites. This is where you will store your favorites!
It will also be possible to easily extend or modify recipies. For example if you during cooking realize the dish is missing a certain ingredient or you need more of another ingredient than the recipie indicate, just change it to your taste!
